# 🎯 Options Robot Market Hours Testing Guide

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS: Testing During Market Hours

Your options robot is ready for market hours testing! The key issue from your analysis is that bid/ask quotes were 0.00/0.00 because the market was closed. During live market hours, you should see real quotes.

### 📅 WHEN TO TEST

**Brazilian B3 Market Hours:**
- **Monday-Friday:** 09:00 - 17:30 BRT (São Paulo time)
- **Weekend:** Market closed
- **Holidays:** Market closed

### 🔧 TESTING SEQUENCE

#### **Step 1: Check Market Status**
```bash
python check_market_status.py
```
This will show:
- ✅ Current Brazilian time
- ✅ Market status (Open/Closed)
- ✅ Time until next market session

#### **Step 2: Test Live Quotes (Market Hours Only)**
```bash
python test_options_live_quotes.py
```
Expected results during market hours:
- ✅ Real bid/ask quotes (not 0.00/0.00)
- ✅ Live volume and open interest
- ✅ Real-time quote updates every 5 seconds

#### **Step 3: Run Options Robot (Paper Trading)**
```bash
python options_robot.py
```
Choose option 1 (Paper Trading) for initial testing.

### 🎯 WHAT TO EXPECT DURING MARKET HOURS

#### **Target Options Analysis:**
1. **valeg565w2** (VALE call, strike 65)
   - Should show real bid/ask quotes
   - Expected high open interest (14,500+)
   - Watch for bid/ask spread < 15%

2. **valeg545w2** (VALE call, strike 54.5)
   - Secondary target option
   - Expected moderate open interest (4,400+)
   - May have wider spreads

#### **Success Criteria:**
✅ **GOOD SIGNS:**
- Bid > 0.00 and Ask > 0.00
- Bid/Ask spread < 15%
- Volume > 10 contracts today
- Open interest > 1,000 contracts

❌ **RED FLAGS:**
- All quotes still 0.00/0.00
- Spreads > 20%
- Zero volume
- No options available

### ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

#### **If quotes are still 0.00/0.00:**
1. **Check VALE3 is trading:** The underlying stock must be active
2. **Verify option expiry:** Options may have expired
3. **Check holidays:** B3 may be closed for Brazilian holidays
4. **Try different options:** Add more VALE options to test

#### **If spreads are too wide (>15%):**
1. Wait for higher volume periods (10:00-16:00)
2. Try options closer to the money
3. Check if it's options expiry week (high volatility)

### 📊 EXPECTED TIMELINE

#### **Pre-Market (Before 09:00 BRT):**
- Market status checker shows "Pre-market"
- Quotes will be 0.00/0.00 (normal)
- Robot will wait for market open

#### **Market Open (09:00+ BRT):**
- **First 30 minutes:** May have volatile spreads
- **10:00-16:00:** Best liquidity period
- **16:30+:** Force close activated (options robot)

#### **After-Market (After 17:30 BRT):**
- Market closed, robot stops
- Final P&L calculation
- State saved for next day
