## 🚀 TOMORROW'S LAUNCH CHECKLIST

### Before Starting Trading:

1. **Create Database Table** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # If the account_balance table doesn't exist in Supabase:
   # Copy the SQL from create_balance_table.py and run it in Supabase SQL editor
   ```

2. **Set Initial Balance** (optional):
   ```bash
   python setup_initial_balance.py
   # This creates your R$500 initial balance record
   ```

3. **Final Verification**:
   ```bash
   python test_balance_integration.py
   # Should show R$500 balance and all tests passing
   ```

4. **Start Trading**:
   ```bash
   python robot.py
   # Select paper trading first to test, then live trading
   ```
